## About the GenofIT training course - QA Manual Pro
   The course was focused on giving me **practical experience.** I wrote a lot of **test cases, bug reports.** I learned more and got to know **front-end testing in practice.** Also learned more about **accessibility testing** and the tools that can be used to implement it. Besides in practice I used one of the tools called Wave, which is used in accessibility testing. It was a very interesting experience for me.
